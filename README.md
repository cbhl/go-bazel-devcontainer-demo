## Roadtrip Playlist Tool

This repository includes a comprehensive **Roadtrip Playlist Tool** built with Go and Bazel. The tool helps create playlists from vlog videos using AI analysis, video processing, and cloud storage integration.

### ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Video Processing**: Split large video files into manageable chunks using ffmpeg
- **Cloud Storage**: Upload video chunks to Google Cloud Storage
- **AI Analysis**: Analyze video content using Gemini 2.5 Flash to identify music
- **Data Export**: Convert analysis results to CSV format with relaxed JSON parsing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests with mock clients for development and testing

### ðŸ“š Documentation

The playlist tool documentation is located in `scripts/roadtrip/`:

- **[README.md](scripts/roadtrip/README.md)** - Main tool documentation with usage examples
- **[PLAN.md](scripts/roadtrip/PLAN.md)** - Development plan and project phases

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
